The in-cooperation forms should be submitted about 4 months in advance.
So, ideally the fall conference forms should be submitted in April/May,
and the spring conferences should be done in November/December.

One minor wrinkle is that if a fall conference is scheduled on or after
November 8, then the in-cooperation agreement cannot be completed so
far in advance.  This is because of the dating of our insurance policy.
CCSC has an annual insurance policy that renews each year on November 8.
And we are not billed for it until September.  As a result, if there
are any fall conferences held on or after November 8, you would not be able
to complete the in-cooperation until September.  The Treasurer
(currently Brian Hare) should send you the latest proof-of-insurance.
