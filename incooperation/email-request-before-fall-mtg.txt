Email the CCSC Regional Reps before our Fall meeting to request ACM IDs for the conference chair and program chair (must be ACM members). 

Subject

Important! CCSC Regional Reps: please forward to your late Fall / Spring CCSC conference chair and program chair (request to use ACM logo)

Body

CCSC Regional Reps:

If you have a late Fall or Spring conference, please forward this request to your upcoming Conference Chair and Program Chair.

We need the following information (not publicly available) - to request permission before your regional  conference can use the ACM logo on their web site. 

Reminder: SIGCE requires that Conference Chairs and Program Chairs be ACM and/or SIGCSE members.  

Program Chair – Full Name and ACM/SIGCSE ID Number – or - 
•	First, Last
•	Affiliation – MUST BE A MEMBER
•	Street
•	City, State, Zip, Country
•	Email
•	Phone

Conference Chair – Full Name and ACM/SIGCSE ID Number – or – 
•	First, Last
•	Affiliation – MUST BE A MEMBER
•	Street
•	City, State, Zip, Country
•	Email

And the following conference information:

•	Conference Name (e.g. CCSC-XX ’23: 2023 Computer Science Conference):
•	Conference Dates:
•	Website
•	Conference location:

•	Estimate: Number of sessions 
•	Estimate: Number of papers 
•	Estimate: Conference attendance 
•	Estimate: Conference total budget
•	Estimate: Conference total expenses (hopefully, not more than budget)

We just got our updated insurance certificate, so as soon as we get their IDs and conference information, we can request permission – apologies to the SE late Fall conferences for the challenging schedule. If you have an early Fall conference, you’ll get a similar request just before our Spring meeting. 

Kindest regards, 

CCSC Vice President
