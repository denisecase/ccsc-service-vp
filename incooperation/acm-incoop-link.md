-----
The leadership of the ACM sub-unit reviewing the submitted TMRF will consider the following:

Dates
Does it conflict with other conferences or symposia that the members of this Special Interest Group might attend?
Is there is a potential overlap of audience? Conferences cannot be approved without the consent of the conference chair of the already approved conference.
Is it a good time of year with regard to workload of the proposed audience?
Technical Merit
Are the conference organizers credible in this technical area?
Does the conference chair have the time to make this conference a success? Does he/she have other commitments which might interfere in the overall management of this project?
Will the technical content attract the audience that the organizers have in mind?
Is this audience part of the membership of your Special Interest Group?
Will the attendees of this conference be sought after as members of your Special Interest Group?
Does this conference substantially overlap with an existing conference enough to impact it?
Financial Considerations
Who is taking the financial risk?
Is that organization the same who stands to gain from hosting this conference?
Is the fund balance of the guarantors large enough to cover 100% loss?
Are there any other sources of funding?
ACM In-Cooperation Arrangements

The in-cooperation form is only to be utilized by conferences seeking ACM/SIG Cooperation. This means that ACM and its sub-unit(s) lend their names but do not share in the financial support or in the surplus or loss of the conference.

Meetings approved for Cooperation may be advertised as "In-Cooperation with ACM (/SIGxx)". The term 'pending' cooperation may not be used.

The sponsors must provide copies of the Certificate of Insurance for liability coverage for the sponsoring organization. For conferences held outside the United States, if the organization is unable to provide a Certificate of Insurance the sponsor MUST provide a letter on the organization's official stationery indicating that they are taking full financial and legal responsibility for the event.

The following conditions must also be met for approval of all conferences:
a signed Statement of Understanding and Hold Harmless Clause must be submitted with the completed TMRF,
registration and proceedings fees will be the same for ACM members as for other sponsoring organizations, with no differentiation in fees between academic and corporate participant registration fees,
if requested, a table or booth where ACM membership and publication information may be displayed and
a brief report must be submitted in writing within 120 days after the meeting to the appropriate ACM/SIG Staff Liaison. The report will be forwarded to the leaders of the sponsoring ACM sub-unit for review. The report will be utilized to consider cooperating support for future conferences. It should summarize the following:
Number of attendees in each of the registration categories.
General assessment of the technical quality of the papers.
General assessment of the quality of the presentations and associated events
Any problem areas encountered by the meeting.
A financial report of the conference.

Resolution of the Free Circulation of Scientists
September, 1974
The XV General Assembly

Having been informed of a number of cases in which bona fide scientists from National adhering bodies of the International Scientific Unions had recently been prevented from attending symposia organized by these Unions through a refusal to grant entry visas and, recalling the earlier decisions taken by the ICSU emphasizing the right to free movement of scientists in this connection, draws the attention of the individual scientific unions and other ICSU bodies to the following guidelines and recommends their adoption:
Before Symposia or Meetings are arranged:
an assurance in writing should be obtained from the organizers in the country concerned that visas will be granted to bona fide scientists if proper applications are made, and
the unfortunate consequences which may arise through failure to grant visas should be communicated to the organizers of the symposia or meetings involved.
The procedure recently adopted by the IUPAC is commended for observance by other union, namely:
that application for visas where necessary should be made to the appropriate authorities not less than three months before the date of the symposium or meeting, and if these visas are not granted or promised in writing one month before the date of the event, sponsorship should be withdrawn, and,
arrangements for future meetings in any country found unable to comply with these principles should be suspended until more satisfactory circumstances exist.
National adhering bodies of the ICSU should urge the authorities in their countries to facilitate attendance and exit visas for scientists to attend such meetings in the same way.
Each Union or other ICSU body should inform the ICSU and its Scientists of cases in which withdrawal of sponsorship has become necessary so that other Unions may take this into account in making their own arrangements for meetings and symposia.
The Chairman of the Committee for Free Circulation and the Secretary General of the ICSU should maintain a record of cases reported, to which scientific unions and other ICSU bodies may refer.
ACM Resolution on Sponsorship of International Conferences as Passed by the ACM Council
May 25, 1975

Moved: ACM Council, desirous of encouraging open information exchange and complete scientific freedom, subscribes to the following policies relating to international scientific conferences sponsored by, or held In-Cooperation with, ACM:
The Council endorses the September 1972 addition to the Statutes of The International Council of Scientific Unions, and affirms that official ACM participation in all conferences shall be guided by the principles expressed in that provision: "In pursuing these objectives of the ICSU, the (ICSU) Council shall observe the basic policy of nondiscrimination and affirm the rights of scientists throughout the world to adhere to or to associate with international act regard to race, religion, or sex."
Council indicates that the implementing guidelines contained in the Resolution on the Free Circulation of Scientists of the ICSU XV General Assembly shall be followed to the extent possible in developing implementing procedures specifically meant for ACM sponsored conferences in or outside the United States, recognizing the responsibility of the ACM Council as final arbiter in such matters.
It is the viewpoint of the ACM Council that the computing community should support only such conferences, whether ACM sponsored or not, that subscribe to these guidelines. However, ACM or any of its sub-units shall not enter into formal agreements on international conference sponsorship or participation unless the sponsoring organization in the host country has agreed to adhere to these principles.
