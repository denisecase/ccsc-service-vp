Subject: [ccsc_board] November 10 Board Meeting

Dear colleagues,

Please make plans to join us in Asheville, North Carolina,
for this fall's CCSC board meeting, held in conjunction with
the Southeast region conference.  The Board meeting will be
held on Thursday, November 10, with the conference beginning
on Friday.

For dinner, I have made a reservation at the Stoneridge Tavern at 5:15 p.m.
The restaurant is located at 1003 Brevard Road.  This is a few blocks
off exit 33 on Interstate 26.  For reference, the freeway exit for the airport
is exit 40.

The board meeting will take place at a conference room located
at the Comfort Suites hotel across the street, at 890 Brevard Road.
The meeting is scheduled for 7:00-11:00 p.m.

The Comfort Suites is one of the hotels that has a block of rooms
set aside for conference attendees.  Other hotels are also available
in the same area.

Complete information about the CCSC-SE conference (including lodging)
can be found here:
http://ccscse.org/conference.php?year=36th

The conference proper will be held at the campus of UNC-Asheville,
which is located about 8 miles from the hotel.

Hope to see all of you there!

--Chris


Additional helpful info:

The Board will have dinner approximately 5:00 or 5:30 until 7:00 p.m. 
and then the meeting itself from 7 to 11 p.m.
The location of the board meeting will be decided in a few days.
One venue has been found, but I am evaluating other options.

If you want to book your hotel now, I recommend that Board members 
stay at either the Comfort Suites or Holiday Inn that are listed here:
http://ccscse.org/lodging.php?year=36th

These two hotels are a couple blocks apart in the same neighborhood.
They are located about 7 miles from the airport and 9 miles
from the university.  

CCSC will pay for your travel, so would love to see all of you in person
if at all possible.  Please make every effort to attend in person.  
Let me know if this is not feasible for you.
