Subject: CCSC - Request New Statement of Insurance when Available

Hi Brian, 

I hear we should be getting our new CCSC Statement of Insurance in September. 

Please email me a copy so I can complete the ACM paperwork for the SE conference that will be held after our old term ends November 8. 

Thank you!
