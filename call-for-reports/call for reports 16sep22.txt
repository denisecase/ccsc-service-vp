Dear colleagues,

Welcome to another great academic year for CCSC!

We are having our semiannual CCSC board meeting Thursday November 10, 2022 at Asheville, NC (SE), in conjuction with the Southeastern conference November 11-12 at the University of North Carolina â€“ Asheville in Asheville, NC, with the help of Conference Chairs Marietta Cameron and Kevin Sanft. CCSC President Chris Healy and I are putting together the agenda.  

I need a little help from you.  We need the following reports in the agenda before we meet:

ALL regional reports
publication chair
treasurer
membership secretary
service recognition committee chair
comptroller
national partner's chair
UPE liaison

If you have any of the above roles, please e-mail me your report by Friday, September 23.  

To get an idea of what sort of report to write, you can look up recent board meeting minutes here: 
http://www.ccsc.org/board/documents-public/minutes/

For example, if you are a regional rep, you may have had a conference since our last meeting, or you are gearing up for your next conference.  What news, details or issues would you like to mention at the meeting?

Your reports serve as a historical record for events and decisions that you make.  You know more about your region or position than anyone else on the board.  While it is helpful to include links to Web sites in your report, those links may not be valid several years from now.  Thus, it is important to include all key data in the report itself.

Thank you!
--Denise Case
CCSC Vice President, 2022-2024
