Subject: some background files

Denise,

Here are some files you might find interesting.

voting 2020-2022.xlsx - my spreadsheet of how I kept track of the voting.
Note on the first page I kept a list of all the board members that
I copied from ccsc.org

in coooperation definition.docx - I found some documentation online
explaining exactly what "in coooperation" means to ACM.

Report Content Suggestions.pdf - In case anyone asks, a detailed outline
of what could go into a regional rep report.

The last two files pertain to getting reimbursed for travel
and election expenses.  I think they are also on our Web site.
Brian Hare, our treasurer, can clarify how to fill them out.  
Off the top of my head I'm not sure, but I recall it was simpler than it looks.
For example, we only get reimbursed by way of a paper check.
So, the pages pertaining to other forms of payment are not applicable.

Later, I will send you instructions on how to do the In-Cooperation
agreements and conduct the online elections.

--Chris
