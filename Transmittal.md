Subject: files for in-cooperation forms

Denise,

I've attached a zipped-up folder containing information
on how to complete the in-cooperation forms.
It also includes example files that I created from the
recent past, such as the "statements of understanding"
and approval letters for 4 of the fall 2022 conferences.
Over time, you will need to create analogous files for
future CCSC conferences.

I've also attached my signature image that you may use
as my signature on one of the letters we have to submit to ACM.

Thanks for taking care of all of this!  Let me know if you
need anything else.

--Chris
