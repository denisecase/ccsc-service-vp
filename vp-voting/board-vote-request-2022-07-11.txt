Subject: [ccsc_board] please vote

Dear colleagues,

Please vote today or tomorrow on the two motions announced recently by Karina.
You can vote by simply sending me an e-mail.

Unusually, we have 2 motions to vote on at the same time.
When you vote, please indicate how you wish to vote on EACH motion.
To streamline the procedure, I will assume the following:

If you vote "yes" without specifying which motion, I will assume you are voting yes on both motions.
If you vote "no" without specifying which motion, I will assume you are voting no on both motions.

If you wish to split your vote (yes for one, no to the other), then it is imperative
that you indicate which motion is which.  The same is true if you wish to vote
for one motion while abstaining from the other.  You may abbreviate the
motions as the "SIGCSE motion" and "Other regions motion", so I can understand your intent.
If you prefer to refer to the motions as the "first" and "second" motion, then
I will assume that the "first" motion is the SIGCSE e-mail motion and the second motion is on
e-mails from other regions.

If I don't understand how you are voting, I may ask for clarification from you.
We need to get all of the voting done by tomorrow, so I encourage you to vote ASAP.
After Tuesday, unresolved ambiguous voting will be treated as abstaining.

thanks, 
Chris
